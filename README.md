# graphs and dynamic programming

This repo is a work in progress

Discussion and problem solving on the topics of:
* Graph Algorithms 
* Max Flow Networks
* Dynamic Programming and principle of optimality

For the purpose we will follow the notation introduced in the book ["Digraphs: Theory, Algorithms, and Applications"](https://github.com/dimitarpg13/graphs_and_dynamic_programming/blob/master/books/DigraphsJensenGutin.pdf) by Jensen and Gutin. 

Specifically we will discuss in details and will be writing python code for the following algorithms:

- [Branch-and-bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_bound)
- [Branch-and-cut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_and_cut)
- [Breadth-First-Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)
- [Depth-First-Search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depth-first_search)
- Backtracking

- [Dijkstra's shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm)
- [Bellman-Ford shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman%E2%80%93Ford_algorithm)
- [Floyd-Warshall shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floyd%E2%80%93Warshall_algorithm)

- [Ford-Fulkerson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford%E2%80%93Fulkerson_algorithm) / [Edmonds-Karp max flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edmonds%E2%80%93Karp_algorithm)
- [Push-relabel max flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push%E2%80%93relabel_maximum_flow_algorithm)

- [Tarjan's strongly connected components](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarjan%27s_strongly_connected_components_algorithm)

- [Kruskal's min spanning forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm)
- [Boruvka's min spanning forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bor%C5%AFvka%27s_algorithm)
- [Prim's min spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prim%27s_algorithm)
- [reverse-delete min spanning tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse-delete_algorithm)


We will look into using open source python packages such as [dynamic-programming](https://pypi.org/project/dynamic-programming/) and [networkx](https://networkx.org/).
